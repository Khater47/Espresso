# Espresso
Espresso is a social media mobile application that is designed using web technologies (Client-Server architecture).
## Client 
Client-side was implemented using React JS, the app was designed using the iPhone 12 pro screen size as a reference, so to get the best and proper visual experience we advise using the chrome developer tools and setting the screen size to iPhone 12 pro.
### Running the client
from the root directory of the application navigate to the client folder `cd client`, then run `npm i` to install all dependencies, and when the installation is done run `npm start`.
## Server
The server side was implemented using node JS and Express to implement a basic backend server that uses SQLite as a database.
### Running the server
We assume nodemon is installed globally on your machine, if not, please install it.<br/>
From the root directory of the application navigate to the server folder `cd server`, then run `npm i` to install all dependencies, and when the installation is done run `nodemon server.js`.
