- Using toasts/tooltips for feedbacks 

- Reocnsider the whole application width

- Add the go back set state in all the pages (Not avaialabel in blocked trends)

- Pages flcutates due to multiple api calls and filtering in FE

- Blocking a priority trend should be allowed ?

- all icons to be reconsidered during styiling

- Confirmation modal for delete post

- New page for break ended 

- Cancel button for timer already running

- hide filters on blocked trends

- Add note icon and add post icon

- Trend text scrolls a bit on x

- timer default value on zero should be empty

- timer color if on or not , because user can set a timer and not run it 

- set timer on large number gives validation error , but going back looks like timer is running



# Notes

 - React sends requests twice , may be that's why go back sometimes needs to be clicked twice
 
 - Parent route renders again in bg everytime a child is rendered
